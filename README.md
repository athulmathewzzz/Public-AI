#Public-AI
So this is a weird kind of repository. My idea is that all of the python developers will come together and develop an AI using Python. Everybody can contribute. The repository will be starting off with a basic main.py. Anybody can write anything to improve this AI. It can be a minor functionality to a major functionality. Anything. It is your freedom. A complex AI. By every python developers who knows machine learning out there. Good luck.
But Wait a minute there is one rule:
    The code should run in every platform like linux, windows, MacOSX
